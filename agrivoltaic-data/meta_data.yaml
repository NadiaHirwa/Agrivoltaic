  description: |
    This dataset provides experimental data collected from a pilot agrivoltaic system in Ghana. The study examines the integration of solar energy production with crop cultivation under agrivoltaic photovoltaic (PV) panels.  

    ### Description of Experimental Site:  
    The site consists of three plots:  
    - **Plot 1 (Control Field):** A traditional agricultural site without PV panels.  
    - **Plot 2 (Agrivoltaic System):** Raised PV panels allowing concurrent solar energy production and crop cultivation.  
    - **Plot 3 (Ground-Mounted PV):** Traditional ground-mounted PV panels without crop cultivation.  

    Test crops include tomatoes, chilli pepper, and eggplant. Plots 1 and 2 are further divided into nine subplots for replicated experiments.  

    Data collected includes measurements of irradiation, temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, and rainfall across the experimental plots.  

    ### Key Features:  
    - **AG-PV:** Data from agrivoltaic PV panels.  
    - **AO-TI & AO-SS:** Temperature, relative humidity, and soil moisture in control fields.  
    - **PO-PV:** Data from control PV panels.  
    - **WS:** Ambient weather data, including temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall.  

    ### Data Format:  
    Each column represents:  
    - **Parameter:** Measurement type (e.g., Irradiation, Temperature, Relative Humidity).  
    - **Plot Location:** The specific experimental plot (e.g., AG-PV, AO-TI).  
    - **Unit:** Units of measurement (e.g., W/m², °C, %, mm).  

    ### Applications:  
    This dataset is ideal for research on renewable energy, agrivoltaics, and sustainable agriculture in Africa.
